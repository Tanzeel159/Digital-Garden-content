## Notes
- first they are trying to target ad-block extensions by implementing [manifest V3](manifest%20V3.md).
- With web environment integrity they are essentially trying to DRM the internet.
- users getting tricked into installing apps/malware happens because regular websites have confusing ads. 
- with this approach they provide API where service providers can implement it in such a way that website requests token from third party (Google in this case) and verifies if client environment is secure etc. 
- Now google will only provide that if devices meets specifications i.e no ad blockers, no tampering thereby forcing users to stick to default settings watching all ads.
- They also clearly mention target audience should be humans not bots so I guess ad revenue has shrinked with advertisers demanding strict action because of ad blockers. 
- This is a serious threat to open web imo. 
- Brief explainer
