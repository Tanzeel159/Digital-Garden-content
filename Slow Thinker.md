## Notes
- It's always better to comment on something when you have updated knowledge about it. 
- Blindly commenting when certain input will lead to misunderstandings and also might give wrong impression. 
- It's always better to comment later when all thoughts have formed and if the situation is unavoidable then refrain from having any rigid stance on pressing issues.
