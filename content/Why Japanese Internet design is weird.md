## Notes
- statistical method - dimensionality reduction used to group website screenshots(T-SNE)
- websites are brightly coloured, dense 
- 3 reasons:
	1) characters(65k glyphs -> character representation)
	2) culture
	3) technology(revolution happened a decade early, love for outdated tech, mostly browse on older devices hence website design didn't change)
- few font options, lack of hierarchy
- we all see the world through cultural glasses
- The lens with which your brain sees the world shapes your reality.
- it shapes how we think, what we pay attention to and how we perceive things. 
- Culture -> characteristics, values, knowledge, lifestyle within group of people or place
- east Asian -> china, japan, south Korea
- western culture -> UK, Germany, USA , Australia , Canada.
- [culture psychology](culture%20psychology.md)
- westerners -> analytical thinkers(focus on individual objects, their attributes)
- easterners -> holistic thinkers (see picture as a whole, focus on relationships of objects)

- east Asians tend to process 60% more info and find twice as many relationships compared to westerners.
- hence the designers cram lot of info in websites because they know their audience will be able to find what they want

- there is no right wrong culture
- even advertising is affected because of it

- understanding this allows us to perceive the culture differently and enable us to see the world through someone else's lens.
