## Notes
- Creationism is a belief that says everything was created by a higher power, like a god or a divine being. 
- According to creationism, this higher power made everything in the universe, including the Earth, animals, and humans, in a special way. 
- Creationists often believe that this happened exactly as described in religious texts, like the Bible.
