Here are the tools I use :

1) [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - for taking notes on articles, books, podcasts and capturing ideas.
2) [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read) - for capturing highlights, taking notes and reading articles, blogs, tweets and keeping myself up-to-date with my RSS feed.
3) [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) - for synchronizing my notes across devices. 
4) [GitHub](https://github.com/) - for forking commits from upstream development
5) [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) - for publishing my digital garden
6) [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - To deploy my notes
