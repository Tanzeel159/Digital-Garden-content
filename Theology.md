## Notes
- Theology is like a big puzzle about [God](God.md) and [Religion](Religion.md).
- It's about trying to understand and make sense of things like who God is, why we believe in God, and how we should live our lives based on those beliefs.
- We should examine arguments and evidence presented by religious believers to support the evidence of god.
- critically analyze religious texts, philosophical arguments, and scientific claims to evaluate their validity and coherence.
