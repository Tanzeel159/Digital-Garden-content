## Notes
- Meeseeks are exact opposite about humans
- We humans have need for finding meaning/purpose in anything and everything, work/relationships/leisure activities/death
- for many of us the idea that we are meaningless, merely existing, we are here for no purpose is too much to bear.
- Most like to believe we exist for greater purpose
- defining meaning (purpose) is need of a conscious mind
