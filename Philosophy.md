- Definition -  *Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as [existence](existence.md),[knowledge](knowledge.md),[values](values.md),[reason](reason.md),[mind](mind.md) and [language](language.md).)*
- Philosophy begets science.
- Philosophy is very important topic as it defines how we acquire knowledge, how we [compute](compute.md) and process everything.
- Philosophy shouldn't be skipped IMO because to understand how world works, we must have concrete knowledge and philosophy is a means for that knowledge covering [Epistemology](Epistemology.md),meta - knowledge , [logic](logic.md), [mathematics](mathematics.md), social concepts etc.
- Philosophy helps us generalize our thoughts, concepts ..helps us transform our model of the world we know.

### Philosophy is the ultimate purpose of life

> [!quote]
> Without philosophy life would be a meaningless

Ultimately, our inquiry of knowledge is unlimited(as it should be rather than accept what is said), we will never likely reach our maximum knowledge potential, as it is simply impossible . The universe will die before , [Big Crunch](./Big%20Crunch.md).

Should we jump off from this infinite treadmill(quest of acquisition of knowledge or is it the purpose of life ? (No regrets there tbh)

The search for [Compound Knowledge](Compound%20Knowledge.md) will be fulfilling one which includes "Philosophy".

- Philosophy is different from other ways of addressing fundamental questions (such as [mysticism](mysticism.md), [myth](myth.md), [Religion](Religion.md)) by being critical and generally systematic by relying on [Rational Argument](Rational%20Argument.md) . 
- It involves logical analysis and clarification of ideas, concepts. 
- Philosophy -> Greek Word -> Philosophia  -> "Wisdom of words" !
