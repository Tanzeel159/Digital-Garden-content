## Highlights
- want to do something, Jim does a calculation:
  > How much time and energy will this take, and how much reward will it bring? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13a0af71py05rty0kpk4xwk))
- If Jim thinks the reward on effort is too low, he puts a “tax” on that activity. It’s still *possible* to do it, but it requires a lot of willpower. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13a0kn4d61qa1qtps476hfn))
- Jim is stubborn and opinionated and sceptical and illogical. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13a1jzbvxdz5tdz28ng2dvt))
- Taxum 1: Doing the thing is too unpleasant compared to not doing the thing ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13frbfzbehq798c87v6sk7j))
- Taxum 2: You don’t really believe that doing the thing will work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13frpvdxaf6n12agh66a1qx))
- You don’t think you have the ability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fs4sfg0cgkrdjsymd22x6))
- You don’t think you have a good plan. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fsc0mazprh0dfspg8663n))
- Even if you successfully did the thing, you don’t really think it will matter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fsj33y4wpx5jg0kgkydfx))
- You think no one else will care ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fsnkb35mfzpbn39asv88p))
- You yourself won’t care. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fsse3de2a7r94926epg3a))
- Taxum 4: The timeline is too long ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13ft185wsmfb3g8nrbta2ws))
- if you’re procrastinating, look for the bottleneck. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13aakezzw30j61gcd1ny94w))
- **Do a different thing.** So far we’ve tried to outmaneuver Jim. But sometimes he’s right. Maybe you *can’t* do the thing, or it *won’t* matter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fwegsqnv9jcjwft0rqsf3))
- We say we want to get in better shape so we can “be healthier”. But really we want to be hotter so we can date hotter people or impress folks at work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fxs4g7j3g1arbf7e4ay9x))
- be brutal about your motivations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h13fxhh10w8kehbectfrhwg6))
- Work on the thing with others ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h14qwcfrs0mngph2y8etkbb8))
