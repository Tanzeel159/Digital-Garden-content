## Highlights
- method for automatically generating mathematical proofs to verify software correctness ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0jyw6ns70q35rzzv2wyc7x))
- The technique, known as machine-checking, involves creating a proof that the software performs as expected, and then using a theorem prover to confirm the proof's accuracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0jyzqw22cq3dsw62w8qd1w))
- writing these proofs has been a laborious task, requiring extensive expertise and often resulting in proofs longer than the software code itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0jz6g4fxsm6pzq5jw7vw3c))
