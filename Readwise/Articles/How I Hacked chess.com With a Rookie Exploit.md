## Highlights
- Let's see what happens when I insert a [link](https://i.imgur.com/0PmEjVm.png?ref=skii.dev) for the image. Is the URL embedded directly, or will there be some safe handling to protect against request forgeries? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6ym0mtnhp01pa3vgftk4d2))
- Chess.com handles this server-side by re-uploading the image to their content hosting server and then pointing the image URL to that. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6ym4xt4pvkcv2f3kaxes2f))

- Instead of accepting input and treating it only [as text](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html?ref=skii.dev#safe-sinks), it has to get raw HTML and directly embed it ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hn6za9d2x51cc0sh1ykn999z))
