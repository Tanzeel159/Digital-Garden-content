Summary: The article discusses the three statements "The world is awful," "The world is much better," and "The world can be much better." It emphasizes that these statements are not contradictory but rather true at the same time. The news often focuses on the negative aspects of the world, while ignoring the progress that has been made. However, it is important to acknowledge both the problems and the progress in order to work towards a better world. The article provides data on child mortality to demonstrate how the world has improved but also highlights the need for further progress. It concludes by encouraging individuals to contribute to positive change and make the world a better place.
