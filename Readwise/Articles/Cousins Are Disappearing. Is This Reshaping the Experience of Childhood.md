Summary: The experience of childhood is being reshaped as the number of cousins decreases in many families. A kinship study found that families worldwide are shrinking, with a projected 38% decline in living relatives for individuals aged 65 by the year 2095 compared to 1950. In Canada, the average 15-year-old girl is projected to have only 3.6 living cousins in 2095, compared to 15.3 in 1950. This decline in cousins is attributed to decreasing fertility rates, with more people choosing to have fewer children or no children at all. Cousins play an important role in individuals' lives and provide a source of support and companionship, particularly in disadvantaged minority families. While the decline in cousins is changing the experience of childhood, the building of extended family by choice through close friendships and communities can help mitigate the impact.

By 2095, a Canadian woman aged 35 is projected to have just five living cousins, according to the data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hph0gx1ns1myxn0623029fz4))

- Cousins take up an interesting space in many family dynamics — not quite siblings, not quite friends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hph0marcthezqhkd3v130nhj))
- "If our society and culture celebrate and value developing close friendships and communities and building family we choose to a greater extent, we may not need to worry about a cousin decline so much." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hph0ppnbqqr8mavbjpgstwx1))
