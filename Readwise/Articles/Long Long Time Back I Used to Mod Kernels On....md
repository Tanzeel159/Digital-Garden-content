## Highlights
- phone seamlessly bounced from one tower to another, without you noticing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrft90wn6ekdzxj4svky51))
- hard" handoff is when connection with one tower must break before making with a new one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrf3s9xm81fs252syh5yc9))
- soft" handover is when the new connection is made, there is a bit of overlap, and then the old one is dropped. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrfeetf3vhym4w1x7b1gxz))
- Phone <> cell tower, 2 parallell calls basically start at that point, while the telephone operator still sends data from source call to the other end. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrjy4fnae3dp65gtz5kt6k))
- Then while both connections are strong, the telcom operator switches which incoming data stream it is connecting to the other end. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrk134xft8dp1r3mb6xs73))
- And once that is working for a few milliseconds/seconds at good health, it drops off the older line. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gsyrk3zc84nerpcn3d25dt0b))
