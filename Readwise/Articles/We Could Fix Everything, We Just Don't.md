## Highlights
- What they don’t tell you is that we already have solutions for a **lot** of problems, we just don’t use them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6s9j8ttj6px3kwbr38f559))
- Sometimes this is because the solution is too expensive, but usually it’s because competing interests create a tragedy of the commons. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6s9tttvjq4czqbsf0xxktk))
- Most problems in the modern age aren’t complicated engineering problems, they’re the same problem: coordination failure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6sa3bsb9at43at1fn5gkhj))
- There was just one slice of cheese with a gaping hole in it, because it turns out that some manufacturers decided to let users customize their boot image, thinking it would be harmless, and that by itself was enough to wreak havoc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6scwx9x8e4y7kcm22vva1j))
- Every layer of this problem is a different flavour of coordination failure. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6shdv0y3bgk7msmfdrnezj))
- No one on the team who implemented this either thought that there might need to be a warning about untrusted images, or whoever did bring it up was ignored because it was supposed to be handled by another team. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6shzzjc5s1bzyjbqjj00bc))
- We have decades of experience building in-depth QA processes that we are simply ignoring. **We could fix this, we just don’t**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6sk5qgvk303vp5c8m77gr9))
- The tragedy of the commons only happens when you have a total failure of collective action. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6swt81gtrtgy4yc5x3hn74))
- It is the original symptom of societal enshittification. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6sx6m1vk0zmg1cftze2qy3))
- sickle-cell disease and [costs $2 million per patient](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03590-6) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6sypm0mf26tzn418zfdn72))
- so most people in America simply assume they will never be able to afford any of these treatments ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6syx1gh0mp3rc4cpazyppj))
- This is actually really bad, because if nobody can afford the treatment, then biotech companies won’t bother investing into it, because it’s not profitable! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6sz2w0ng7vke7cjkcbcsvs))
- We have built a society that *can’t properly incentivize* ***CURING CANCER***. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t0082jyg8r7pp5pq3d45t))
- This is despite the fact that socialized healthcare is a proven effective strategy ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t04y8gc9gjs7rvyxjsk6f))
- We don’t need AI to fix things ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t56vsqfph7fsgz6r8am5e))
- We don’t need new technology to solve these problems. We *already know how to do better*. Our society is bad at cooperation simply because it’s run by people who are incentivized to sabotage cooperation in the name of profits. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t5hr8158grtxr5b1q8p14))
- It cannot be fixed by you biking to work, or winning the lottery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t6bc70r0m62g1rbhv8nfe))
- We ***must*** address our coordination failures. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t7khsabvwwmfr28vf1ted))
- We ***must*** build systems that foster better cooperation, or this century won’t be a turning point for humanity, it will be the end of humanity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk6t7s7hejgp3dr4bbtf5mfz))
