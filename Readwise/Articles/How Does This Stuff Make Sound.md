## Highlights
- sound is just vibration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72gpmgss8zmbw6q8xjzvny))
- focus and direct the sound onto a diaphragm which is essentially just a fancy stretched out balloon from before the diaphragm would vibrate and attached to the diaphragm would be a stylus or needle that would cut these vibrations into a wax record creating a 3D line with bumps and valleys ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72jd1hxy4gp2g2mpy1fzf3))
- use that metal record as a stamp on Old plastic frisbees ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72kjr70nx63zsvsm43x0bj))
- drop the needle into the groove the bumps and valleys are going to cause that needle to make the exact same vibrations as the needle that recorded the original sound ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72mk7aq8qdmqetr5srbfqf))
- instead of a flimsy balloon it's a copper coil vibrating in between two magnets as the copper coil moves between the two magnets it makes electricity that goes to a speaker creating sound ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72n5kgw2wf199g1sbqnqfc))
- inside of the microphone you'll find a diaphragm that vibrates when you speak into it just like the balloon the diaphragm is either connected to a copper coil kind of like the record player where the sound vibrates the coil sending different strengths of electricity or the diaphragm is connected to a capacitor which is basically just a fancy plate as you speak the diaphragm moves and this vibration changes the distance causing a change in stored energy resulting again in different strengths of electricity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72qhbxq461waaekp37c3e4))
- Magnetic Tape the paper the recording head is the point of contact the different strengths of electricity make changes to the magnetic fields on the tape surface this creates a little pattern of magnetization that almost exactly replicates the original sound wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72rf66tfkg51d8xvakfj8m))
- we take that electricity and convert it into ones and zeros ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72s891r2b2xne7pdef72jr))
- teeny laser we put these ones and zeros on a disc where pit represents a one and an untouched land represents a zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72sk2pa6znnj7e3q60yn4r))
- it's going to read it also with a laser this laser bounces off the CD if there's a pit it bounces a bit differently and writes down a one there's a land bounces the same and writes down a zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72t5apq1exzt1np4q7hpg3))
- we use a digital to analog converter but you can just call him DAC DAC will generate a certain amount of electricity depending on whether it reads a one or zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72tfs32h394at3zmezktm4))
