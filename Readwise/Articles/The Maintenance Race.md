## Highlights
- the Golden Globe around-the-world solo sailboat race of 1968 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd4xcmy5ynay3rvkw8w31at))
- Its drama continues to echo half a century later because three of the nine competitors became legendary – the one who won, the one who didn’t bother to win, and the one who cheated. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd4xm1e8x0aaaxrgdsgy924))
- ![](https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/fig_1-1-5-2048x1242.png) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd4zmf0d0w1phfewwa8j5kv))
- The Golden Globe Race route reads from the top (England) down and to the right past Africa and Australia, then from the left side across the Pacific and around South America back up to England. Thirty thousand miles; 10 months ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd4zrfyes60gar7wh3by6wm))
- The mariners would navigate like their ancestors, solely by sextant, almanac, chronometer, and nautical chart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd51vx6hkpwbvetk94s4twn))
- ![](https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/71855-scaled-1-2048x1374.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd57nm1f0tvyscqahqakgk7))
- When the storm abated, he spent a whole day reinforcing the structure that held the cabin to the deck, another day rebuilding the self-steering apparatus, and then three days repairing the rudder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5g25d91qtmdekm97r44fd))
- If he had not laid in a supply of materials, tools, and fasteners for such tasks, he would have had to quit the race. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5ga8fb1n50kjbaxpt033d))
- It was his thorough preparation that equipped him to ‘make do and mend’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5gps4789ppjbppsf7sjva))
- At a point halfway around the world, he had no engine and no radio transmitter. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5nk5f5gcbw6f261waxqa1))
- “The only way to overcome my present feeling of depression is to fully occupy myself, so I cleaned and served the remaining bottle screw threads and then gave all the servings a coat of Stockholm Tar. Next I polished the vents and gave them a coating of boiled oil. Whilst I had it out I dabbed the oil on wire and rust patches.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5vegerz879svzhkcxzd55))
- Doing maintenance cures depression. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd5vjke311y7cxrgh53dsx8))
- I always considered Donald Crowhurst an absolutely brilliant innovator . . . but as a businessman, as someone who had to know how the world went, he was hopeless ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd60zv145r44pqn3q5438ym))
- Unfortunately, the 35-year-old Crowhurst was too much of an optimist to take into account the complications that always arise between having an idea and getting it to work. The whole rushed process of building and outfitting his trimaran became a nightmare of argument, delay, extra expense, and chaos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd609b6mqsmc73p2xjpk224))
- He over-prepared for what he knew well and under-prepared for nearly everything else. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd61h4ep5fmdwr2hxwhcr8r))
- Old systems break in familiar ways. New systems break in unexpected ways. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd625m6nsb0zc8vcffzvyhj))
- ![](https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/unnamed-1-1-300x216.jpg) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd628evew43ff9dvnp2qz3q))
- On his 41-foot trimaran, Donald Crowhurst was the last to start the Golden Globe Race. He hoped the boat’s exceptional speed downwind would let him pass the other racers who had started months earlier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd62m364a54vzcs8pg670wc))
- The hatch in the cockpit floor leaked and let in a deluge of salt water on the electrical generator, shutting down his treasured radios. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6fg8yt9v661jq574671ej))
- When he got the generator and radios working again, his brief communications with the world became increasingly vague about where he was exactly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6gzvfmzdz22cfzrgk2es2))
- In parallel with his accurate logbook, he began writing a second, fraudulent logbook with plausible positions and speed that showed a fictional Crowhurst on track to win the race. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6h9nf6a4zk8nr8wxmvdb1))
- Lacking the materials for repair, he flouted the race rules, snuck ashore in Argentina, lied to the locals about who he was, repaired the split with their plywood, and headed back to sea, continuing his sporadic cheery reports of rapid progress past Africa, Australia, and South America, disguising his radio signal so it seemed to be coming from those continents. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6knxevpnc94n3cqzsz93r))
- Optimists like Crowhurst – and me, I confess – tend to resent the need for maintenance and resist doing it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6m1yyff9n5hhkyrgxdyqk))
- Maybe we prefer to think in ideals, and the gritty reality of everything constantly decaying and breaking offends our sense of the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6mhg7zyqkyaj9wx0mg5hn))
- Toward the end of his trip, when his long-range transmitter was irreparably broken, he decided to convert his short-range radiotelephone to long-range Morse code capability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6q3czmvsntgmh4awvsr4x))
- And he succeeded! For a day, he exchanged cables with his backers, his wife, and the BBC. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6qdbfa3yqykkbda0er8p3))
- Crowhurst had been broadcasting an elaborate lie for seven months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6s7f6qmzqckkdzmje845w))
- By now he was sure he would be found out. He might be received back in England in triumph at first, but once his fake logbooks were examined closely, it would all turn to scandal and disgrace ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6s2dpxrwvcxwk42sb4bww))
- Abstraction was the ultimate power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6tr90p9392nrakyx5f65n))
    - Note: same for religion
- “The cabin, after eight months of cramped, unmethodical male housekeeping, smelled as if cabbage juice had been poured over old bedding, allowed to ferment, then baked in a hot oven. Several days’ plates, saucepans, and ripening curry lay in and around the sink; his bed stank.“ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6y0kqx50k7z1q1wap23zt))
- Poor preparation and maintenance led to Crowhurst’s cheat. The cheat led to his death. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6yc2z9jfmh5wrkrrvygsk))
- His excessively optimistic view of the world and himself, which had worked fine on land, was lethal for a man alone at sea in an unfit small boat, marinating for months in two contradictory realities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd6yr10ktjadkn7r1cepn1n))
    - Note: am I over optimistic with my master's decision ? Even I would be faced with the sea of the unknown , surrounded by new people, new ideas , new problems, very less support. Am I over optimistic that I will get good grades while managing everything ? What should I do ?
- He had invested so much of himself in an illusion that when it shattered, he shattered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd729dqnyh1zjvpv47epsmw))
- Moitessier had dealt with most of his maintenance issues **in advance**. Everything about the design and construction of his boat and everything about his outfitting for the race was a result of his decades of learning exactly what it takes for a small boat to thrive in the brutal Southern Ocean. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd75y2qjvqd8w7x11txvxv9))
- He knew that once at sea, the need for maintenance had to be minimal, and doing it had to be easy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd766pzc65dpjx8fsvx62ec))
- With money from an admirer, Moitessier had it built of heavyweight steel at a boilerplate factory in France. ‘Ah, steel’, he wrote. ‘Watertight bulkheads, tanks welded right to the hull, incomparable rigidity, welded chain-plates, and an absolutely watertight boat that you clean with a broom and dustpan instead of a bilge pump.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd77cwewrhedmapra74zxhx))
- The critical maintenance issue with steel is corrosion. The answer, he wrote, is ‘paint, paint, and more paint’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd77spzjcg94e4zzk5sagtj))
- ‘Simplicity is a form of beauty.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7ev3zj1pfpnb1we6est31))
- ‘Given a choice between something simple and something complicated’, he wrote, ‘choose what is simple without hesitation; sooner or later, what is complicated will almost always lead to problems’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7f5x03824c8mxwn4eqyeq))
- His self-steering gear was easy to repair because it had none of the usual complicated linkages or line attachments. He didn’t bother to install interior heating because, thanks to a watertight cabin, reliably dry clothing would keep him warm enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7fsmqj1y5k2cqm90wjb00))
- To substitute for what he described as ‘two or three hundred pounds of noisy radio equipment’, he had a slingshot for launching film canisters containing his messages onto the deck of passing ships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7gn10c6z9z8anec5kyebn))
- His cabin light was a kerosene lantern. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7gpzrvkqndqsvqa28jgbt))
- Moitessier emptied his boat of absolutely everything but the basics. With less stuff, there was less to maintain. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7hsb9jwh0t08n2yn1fggc))
- Thanks in part to his paring down, though he had left England more than two months after Knox-Johnston, he was sailing so much faster he might well catch up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7j4sgjn1dhmgx9hbzt6rm))
- His years at sea had taught him that if you don’t fix something when you first see it beginning to fail, it is very likely to finish failing just when it is the most dangerous and the hardest to deal with, such as in the midst of a storm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7n8j86s342aq86y4gwv72))
- He loved doing routine maintenance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7p10trw4makxfaf33vh1d))
- His reward for a boat functioning like new every day was this: ‘I spend my time reading, sleeping, eating. The good, quiet life, with nothing to do.’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd7phnjwaa7kmyy5nyfmv9j))
- “My intention is to continue the voyage, still nonstop, toward the Pacific Islands, where there is plenty of sun and more peace than in Europe . . . I am continuing nonstop because I am happy at sea, and perhaps because I want to save my soul.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd81erja3gfabpe04v5gp33))
- So it was Robin Knox-Johnston who won both the Golden Globe and the prize of £5,000 – which he gifted to Donald Crowhurst’s bereaved wife and young children. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd82jqsds2kzmea2ty0xw13))
- The different maintenance styles of the three sailors led directly to their different outcomes.
  Knox-Johnston’s style was: “*Whatever comes, deal with it.*” And he did.
  Crowhurst’s was: “*Hope for the best.*” It killed him.
  Moitessier’s was: “*Prepare for the worst.*” It freed him.
  Sir Robin Knox-Johnston won the Golden Globe Race.
  Bernard Moitessier won the maintenance race. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnd84xcvgy2jp48maczndx1d))
