## Notes

- UI(User Interface) vs UX(User Experience) -> UI is the way something looks and UX is how it works, how somebody uses it

## UX task flows vs User flows

## What do I know about customer/user ?

- what they're about ?
- their values, mission 
- who am I helping ?
- Why are we helping ?
- what is the direction we are going ?

## Hifi/Lofi

- Lofi/Wireframe - easy, quick to make, focus on mechanics
- Hifi/Hi Fidelity - takes time, important for testing from users
- create frames in Figma -> in the design file press F 
- ctrl +,-,scroll wheel to zoom in/out, space to move the frames around together

## Frames vs Groups

- frames can exist without groups, they offer more features compared to groups. For example clipping the content

- allows to reuse components

## How to prototype

- go to prototype section
- select the frame, connect different frames or elements on one frame to another
- add animation effects
- preview or present

- remove the animating element from the frame
- select smart animate and effect
- place the animating element inside frame from the sidebar
- preview
