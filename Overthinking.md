## Notes

- When you keep thinking or worrying about the same thing.
- **4 types of Overthinking**:
	1) Rumination about past
	2) Worrying about future
	3) Overanalysing decisions
	4) social anxiety

## How to Identify it

- **Noticing and naming** - get good at identifying overthinking . Say it out loud "I am overthinking" or ask someone else to keep check on it and point it out .
- **Identify your triggers** - What time of day, where (work/home), what kind of situations trigger it (prepare yourself and shift your focus to something else)
- **Set an alarm** - track how much you overthink (usually happens when you have free time)

## How to fix it

- **Postpone it** - you can set a particular time when you will deal with it. This is a very powerful. You will learn you have lot more influence than you thought .
- **set time limit** - say you can worry about something daily for certain amount of time (~ 30 mins)
- **Write it down** - write whatever it is you are worrying about .
- **Shift focus** - imagine you have remote and you are changing channel (very awful to something more calm/composed other way to look at things).
> [!caution]
> if you don't direct your focus, you may fall back into rumination
- turn attention from inner world of negative thinking to present moment
- **Shift Thinking** - change from abstract thinking to concrete thinking. avoid overgeneralizations (Why can't I be successful like others/ Why can't I be happy like my friends) -> leads to helplessness, self-loathing 
- instead of focusing on big vague things, concentrate on small actionable things
- Why questions usually lead to rumination (Why am I a failure ?)/ (why do I overthink ? ) 
- What is one small thing I can do to make myself better ? 
- **Shift to your values** - retrain your brain to think about what you really care (what do you want your life to be about ? ) 
- overthinking -> withdraw, isolate 
- **Distraction** - temporarily stop overthinking (breaking bad habit, use as first short-term step, if continued life will lack purpose)
- Face your problems directly
