Welcome to my "Digital Garden". Whatever you read here is how I think, and we all think differently and that's completely fine. So in reality, it may so happen that I tell you the same information differently. This is my little corner on the internet where I publicly share my notes related to what I'm learning, reading, consuming etc. Feel free to explore and learn with me.

> AÂ [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)Â is an online space at the intersection of a notebook and a blog, where digital gardeners shareÂ **seeds of thoughts**Â to beÂ **cultivated in public**. Instead of polished articles displayed in reverse chronological order like a blog, a digital garden is more like a free form, work-in-progress wiki.
