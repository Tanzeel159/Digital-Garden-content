## Notes

- **Figma design** -> it's a tool for people to create, share and test designs for websites, mobile apps etc.  Useful for designers, writers, developers involved in design process. 
- They can easily collaborate since it's cloud based application.
- **FigmaJam**  -> we can create online whiteboards with it similar to [Miro](https://miro.com/) I guess. useful for brainstorming, planning, research.
