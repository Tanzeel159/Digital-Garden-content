## Notes
- Hypothetical scenario for ultimate fate of universe where the expansion of universe eventually reverses and the universe re-collapses, ultimately causing the cosmic scale factor to reach zero , event potentially followed by reformation of universe with another [What existed before Big Bang](What%2520existed%2520before%2520Big%2520Bang.md#)
- [Dark Energy](Dark%20Energy.md) is seen as constant, then universe will probably not collapse and just keep expanding
- We have evidence for that where X-rays and UV rays suggest dark energy is getting stronger over time.
- Universe expanding at faster rate
